# Native Go release agent

The Go business runtime never receives the Docker socket. The isolated
`frontiercloud-updater` binary exposes only a bounded local Unix control socket
with `status` and `start` requests. There is no TCP listener, command execution
API, Compose CLI, systemd or Python dependency. Control directory traversal and
socket access are limited to the fixed application group; status and private
replacement journals are separate, atomically synced 0600 files.

## Persistent release boundaries

A start is serialized with a one-task queue and published to disk before waking
the worker. Malformed/duplicate-key/trailing/oversized requests, unknown fields,
wrong types, non-full lowercase commit SHAs and unknown modes are rejected.
One OS runtime lease prevents a second agent from unlinking a live socket.
Corrupt persistent state fails closed; interrupted queues are not auto-replayed.

The control socket has two disjoint `start` forms: the legacy full `target_sha`,
or a bounded whole `release_manifest`. Both require `mode` (`upgrade` or
`rollback`), and optionally a boolean `hold_maintenance` (default false).
A whole manifest cannot also contain `target_sha`, even an empty value. The
daemon selects the artifact using its durable local publication policy; the
executor independently verifies exact reviewed-tree/CI evidence before any
replacement. Null/unknown/nested-duplicate manifest fields and unknown request
fields are rejected before publishing queue intent. A successful whole-manifest
acknowledgment binds its common `release_id` and locally selected `target_sha`.
The actual Unix wire entry point, not merely direct daemon calls, is covered by
regression tests for both supported private policies.

Production branches are explicitly `main` or `gin_main`. The separate native
Master verifier checks reviewed tree and newest successful source push CI before
queueing. The updater independently fetches the configured production ref,
requires exact HEAD for upgrade and production ancestry for rollback, and refuses
tracked working-tree changes. Immutable allowlisted `git archive` input excludes
working-tree data, secrets and `.git`; no checkout/reset is performed.

Images are pinned by full revision, native runtime/component and compatible
generation labels. Service discovery requires exactly one matching Compose
project/service. Snapshots retain mounts, environment, security, resource limits,
health configuration and explicit network aliases. Old container-ID aliases and
dynamically assigned addresses are not reused. An unrelated container occupying
a saved name is never removed. Container removal never removes business volumes.

Before replacement, a durable private journal preserves all original service
snapshots. A separate mounted native helper closes/drains the local lifecycle
fence; executing that command inside the draining Web container would kill the
helper prematurely. Offline preparation only admits an existing current
generation 3 store and never performs reverse DDL. A generation-2 first upgrade
requires a separate backed-up maintenance migration before entering this
release path; older images cannot be relabeled as compatible. Native initializers, Web
health and rendered/running Nginx configuration must succeed before committing
the new local generation. Docker stop/wait/build use different bounded deadlines.

Local replacement failure restores exact previous image IDs and configuration
under native maintenance. Uncertain or failed recovery retains its journal and
the release fence. Once the healthy local generation has been durably committed,
Follower distribution failure retains that generation rather than rolling it
back. The native Master convergence command uses fresh identity/relationship
checks, at most four calls concurrently, and bounded signed start/status polling.
Neither role changes nor peer database/runtime names are used as compatibility
shortcuts. A no-op generation retry still rechecks Web and Nginx health.

## Compiled updater handoff

Replacing services is not enough to update a compiled Go agent. A target-image
handoff helper receives its own durable journal, stops the old agent, replaces
only its exact saved container and starts the new immutable image. The restart
checkpoint is persisted before helper launch. Old-process cancellation cannot
overwrite it. The new agent checks its compiled revision, target service images,
health and persistent state before claiming success or reopening public traffic.
Mismatched/restarted old code fails closed. No mutable checkout is interpreted
as proof that the running binary changed.

Handoff helpers also hold an exclusive retained OS lease. A failed target create/
start restores the exact previous native updater image/configuration, publishes
a durable failed checkpoint and leaves the committed Web generation intact under
maintenance. A lost successful start reply is reconciled before fallback; a
running target is never replaced with old code merely because an acknowledgment
was lost. The replacement daemon proves its live control image before retiring
the exact project-owned helper and handoff journal. Unknown helper ownership or
fallback provenance is never treated as removal authority.

Only exact obsolete native release tags belonging to the configured project are
eligible for cleanup. Current/previous releases, unrelated tags/projects, shared
parents, business volumes and in-use images are not force-deleted. Helper
containers do not inherit service aliases or published ports.

New updater builds use `frontiercloud-COMPONENT:SHA-PROJECTHASH`, where PROJECTHASH
is the first twelve hex characters of SHA-256 of the exact configured project.
This bounds Docker tag length and separates concurrent projects building the
same release on one Engine. The full project label and exact revision/component
provenance remain mandatory; the short namespace is not authorization by itself.
Existing unsuffixed bootstrap images remain admissible by immutable image proof.
Cleanup ignores foreign namespaces even if their labels claim the local owner.
Python updater sources are non-executable syntax references only. The native updater alone enforces namespace-scoped, bounded, non-forced tag cleanup; it never prunes shared parents. An inventory failure retains images and skips optional cleanup without turning a healthy committed generation into failure.

Native image compilation bounds package parallelism to one and compiler runtime
parallelism to two (`-p=1`, build-command-only `GOMAXPROCS=2`). These limits are
not runtime environment defaults. Acceptance drivers run serially on small hosts;
concurrent fleet compilation must not be mistaken for a backend runtime budget.

Failed native releases retain a bounded phase/error category in status rather
than publishing raw executor errors, environment values or child-process output.
This improves failure attribution without reopening the maintenance fence.

## Site availability is not offline recovery

The existing Admin site maintenance API has a native implementation with
session/CSRF/verified HTTPS and an intent audit before mutation. Atomic public
flags and updater override clearing share an OS lease. Busy or unknown updater
state cannot authorize reopening. Explicit reopening after a failed release
retains the established manual override contract, but cannot defeat/remove the
stronger `.frontiercloud-native-maintenance` fence. Unknown flag bytes/types and
symlinks fail closed instead of being erased.

## Acceptance status

Concrete stateful Engine fault tests cover local replacement versus distribution
commit boundaries and immutable agent handoff. Linux real-driver/race checks and
real Docker archive/build/helper/container replacement tests have passed. The
full native disposable-stack upgrade/handoff/rollback test also passed, including
unprivileged Web access to the group-restricted socket. This uses a fresh private
Git origin and a separate Standalone project, not production CI or five-node
native-fleet acceptance; do not interpret it as either of those gates.
The additional actual whole-manifest stacks passed on SQLite and MySQL on
2026-10-04. They use the unchanged compiled control wire and fixed HTTPS verifier
against a private-CA synthetic publication fixture for real private Git objects.
They cover wrong-tree rejection before replacement, whole history when only the
other profile changes, and manifest retention through upgrade/handoff/rollback.
The other profile's artifact is not executed by this local native proof.
The isolated fixtures do not explicitly redeploy original development nodes.
Historical reconstruction results are archived under docs/audits/go-reconstruction-through-2026-10-05.md. Current acceptance is five native nodes, repeated for Gin/SQLite and Gin/MySQL, on the development host only. Hosted CI remains bounded to three minutes and never executes these stacks. Native default and role restart boundaries are in native-deployment.md. Standalone updater proof alone does not establish whole-fleet convergence, historical migration admission or portable physical restore.

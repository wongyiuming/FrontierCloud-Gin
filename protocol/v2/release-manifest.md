# Runtime-neutral release manifest v1

The optional `release-manifest-v1` feature retains protocol v2. A common
`release_version` labels one release and a canonical SHA-256 identifies its
entire manifest. Neither an application version, language nor DB_TYPE determines
protocol compatibility; `protocol` and `schema_generation` remain explicit.

The complete bounded manifest has `main` and `gin_main` publication profiles,
each mapping to an immutable Git-archive artifact with its own production
commit, reviewed source commit and tree SHA. Profiles represent the existing
fixed local publication policies (`main/dev` and `gin_main/gin_dev`). The Master
must send the whole manifest, never choose a Follower's implementation or copy
its own target SHA to every peer. Each peer selects only its locally configured
policy. SQLite/MySQL does not enter artifact selection or wire identity.

Manifests are at most 8192 bytes. Unknown fields/profiles, duplicate JSON fields,
trailing input, malformed SHAs, boolean/floating protocol numbers, missing
artifacts and unsupported protocol/schema are rejected. See the schema and
historical canonical vectors verified by Go for the exact wire format and canonical digest.

The current native schema gate is generation 3. The original
`vectors/release-manifest.json` remains the unchanged generation-2 historical
fixture; `vectors/release-manifest-generation3.json` defines current acceptance,
including refusal of generation 2 and future generation 4. Historical bytes and
their digest do not authorize a current-schema deployment or reverse migration.

Parsing, a Master signature or a manifest digest alone is NOT publication proof.
Each selected artifact requires independent exact production/source/tree
evidence, an exact merged same-repository source PR and the newest corresponding
successful source push CI. An older success cannot supersede a newer failure.
Rollback additionally requires historical artifact proof and production ancestry;
it must not pick an unrelated local prior SHA or manufacture a previous manifest.

The native Go runtime implements the parser/resolver, independently verified local
artifact queue, durable joint history, authenticated whole-manifest dispatch and
bounded common-digest/private-artifact convergence. Updater status RPC advertises
the optional feature only when its agent supports it; it remains absent from the
general node identity/heartbeat baseline during integration acceptance.

Master Admin requests remain empty: a caller cannot select SHAs or send a
manifest. Set `RELEASE_MANIFEST_PATH` to an absolute container path and explicitly
mount publication metadata read-only there. Both production artifacts require
independent exact CI/PR/tree proof and must be current publication HEADs for an
upgrade. Rollback uses only the durable previous whole manifest and independently
verifies both historical artifacts; each updater also enforces local production
ancestry. This optional file is metadata, not proof or a signature bypass.

During convergence polling, temporary verified control HTTP 502/503/504 responses
from a replacing/draining peer count as not yet converged, within the existing
deadline. They never count as an acknowledgment or success. Authentication errors,
malformed responses, capability/private-profile changes and authority/pin changes
remain failures. Preflight and start dispatch do not inherit this polling retry.

An authenticated Follower status endpoint returns HTTP 503 while its updater
socket is unavailable, including immutable agent handoff. It must not return a
successful empty-capability/profile observation for that gap. Native
endpoints retain their role/authentication checks before probing the agent.

Without that setting, legacy same-SHA releases remain fail-closed across different
publication branches. Current development acceptance uses five native nodes for Gin/SQLite and Gin/MySQL, including whole-manifest upgrade/rollback, live agent proof and post-release restart. It uses synthetic reviewed CI metadata for real private Git objects through the unchanged HTTPS verifier, not published production CI. No Python artifact may be deployed. Publication-asset automation remains separate; see docs/go-only-completion.md.
